# Introduction

Hello,

Welcome to my app, a project about learning and deep dive on React.JS Framework.

# Getting started

We can clone the repo and test on your own, and execute the following command.

Please, make sure that you are inside the project root directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/nirinasoa-herilanto/learning-react.git

// after cloning the project

npm install // use to install all dependencies of the application

npm start // execute the application

```

After executing this command, the application is running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

# Development

On this project, you can switch between all `branches` available on the project to see what's exactly I do/learn on these `topics`.

I named the `branch` according to the `topics` that I learned.
